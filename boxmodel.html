        <p> The actual content inside is 200px wide. 
            The text is padded by 20px left and right, and 10px top and bottom. 
            It has a dotted border 2px thick.
        </p>

        <p> This box has the same exact CSS style applied to it, the distnace
            between the two boxes is 30px. Overlap between margin is a thing.
